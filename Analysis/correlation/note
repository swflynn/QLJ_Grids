Compute the pair correlation and make a histogram
Testing to see if there are peaks (associated with nearest neighor) in the distribution


Conclusion, there are no peaks just a gaussian distribution.
Implies nearest neighbor is not a meaningful cutoff for this problem we cannot simply use nearest neighbor to make a cutoff disk for analysis.

I may just be able to remove this code dont needd on github,m but if I want to edit and understand then I can keep it, it is working code
