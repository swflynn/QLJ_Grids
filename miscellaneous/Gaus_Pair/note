00 is initial test (uses most recent version of grid generation)
i.e. only accept a move when the energy decreases

01 uses the older version where we use the expotential to define acceptance

neither version is working currectly

Seems like we need a steeper repulsion term to force particles apart, they seem to cluster here.
